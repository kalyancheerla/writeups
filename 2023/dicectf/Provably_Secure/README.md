This is just a simple understanding the code challenge.

Here, we have to figureout the `m_bit`. After looking through the code thoroughly, we can find that with encryption and immediate decryption of previous cipher text provides us with the msg that is picked-up during encryption which lets us to figure out the `m_bit`.

As we have to iterate for 128 times, a simple pwntols script like in here works best.
