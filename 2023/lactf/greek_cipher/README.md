### **Title:** crypto/greek cipher

**Hint:** Substitution Cipher with roman glyphs

**Solution:**
```
Input:
κςκ ωπν αζπλ ιησι χνοςνθ μσγθσρ λσθ ζπι ιηγ δςρθι ψγρθπζ ςζ ηςθιπρω θνθψγμιγκ πδ νθςζε γζμρωψιςπζ? τγ ζγςιηγρ.
κςκ ωπν αζπλ ιησι χνοςνθ μσγθσρ λσθ ψρπξσξοω δονγζι ςζ εργγα? τγ ζγςιηγρ.
ς οςαγ ηπλ εργγα μησρσμιγρ οππα ιηπνεη, γυγζ ςδ ς μσζ'ι ργσκ ιηγτ.
οσμιδ{ς_ενγθθ_νθςζε_τσζω_εργγα_μησρσμιγρθ_κςκζ'ι_θιπψ_ωπν._λγοο_ψοσωγκ_ς_τνθι_θσω.μπζερσιθ!}
```

We can easily guess that,\
`οσμιδ` = `lactf`.
So, by replacing these chars and guessing few common words like of, in, is, you, that etc., we can figure out the msg and flag as below.
```
Output:
did you know that julius caesar was not the first person in history suspected of using encryption? me neither.
did you know that julius caesar was probably fluent in greek? me neither.
i like how greek character look though, eυen if i can't read them.
lactf{i_guess_using_many_greek_characters_didn't_stop_you._well_played_i_must_say.congrats!}
```

**Flag:** `lactf{i_guess_using_many_greek_characters_didn't_stop_you._well_played_i_must_say.congrats!}`
