**Points**: 50

## Description
You've been provided with a file named decode\_cipher\_2.txt containing 10 examples of plaintext and ciphertext. Your goal is to identify the encryption pattern and decrypt the final ciphertext to reveal the flag. The ciphertext for the flag is located at the end of the file and is as follows: aubcf gywfd jvfvn khfnmxvn id pvucl teji. To aid in the decryption, you might need to use the keyword "OUSooner." Your task is to decrypt this ciphertext and submit the flag in all lowercase. Include the spaces in your answer as well. Can you uncover the hidden message?
