# Network 2: Packet Hunt
** Points**: 50

## Description
We've intercepted a network capture file network\_file\_2.pcap, and it’s up to you to find the hidden flag. Somewhere in the traffic, among all the noise of typical web activity, is your target. Use a network analysis tool to dig through the packets and uncover the flag. The challenge isn’t just spotting the flag—it’s figuring out where it’s been hidden in plain sight.
