# Binary 3: Decode the Compiled Binary
**Points**: 75

## Description
You've been provided with a binary file named `find_me_3`, which is the output of a C program compiled using gcc. Your task is to analyze the binary file and uncover the hidden flag. Use your knowledge to extract the flag from the compiled output. Once you find the hidden message, submit the flag (the flag is case sensitive). Can you reveal the flag?

Note: You can run `./find_me_3 <flag_value>` in order to test if you have gotten the correct flag or not.
