# Network 3: Packet Hunt
**Points**: 75

## Description
We've intercepted a network capture file `network_file_3.pcap`, and it’s up to you to find the hidden flag. Somewhere in the traffic, among all the noise of typical web activity, is your target. Use a network analysis tool to dig through the packets and uncover the flag. The challenge isn’t just spotting the flag—it’s figuring out where it’s been hidden in plain sight.
