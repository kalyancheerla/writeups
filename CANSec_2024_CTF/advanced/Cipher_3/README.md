# Cipher 3: Decode the RSA Cipher
**Points**: 75

## Description
You've been provided with a ciphertext that has been encrypted using RSA. The ciphertext is as follows: 145844668068067239154. Your task is to decrypt this ciphertext to reveal the flag. You will need to use the public key (n, e): (150000000355000000133, 65537) and apply your knowledge of RSA decryption. Your goal is to decrypt the ciphertext and submit the flag (the flag is case sensitive). Can you uncover the hidden message?
