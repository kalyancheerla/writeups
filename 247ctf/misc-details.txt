# 1 - The text editor jail
vim in a browser

# 4 - Error reporting protocol
bunch of ICMP packets
can be seen exchanging picture
extracted it using tshark (data bytes of a ICMP packet)
tshark -r <input_pcap_file> -x | vi -
vim global (g) magic
:g/0000/d # delete lines
:g/0020/exe "normal! 0w10dw" # to get exact offset
# delete unnecessary lines

# 5 - Not my modulus
Given bunch of private keys and TLSv1.2 pcap file
Tried to understand TLSv1.2 protocol
wireshark -> Edit -> preferences -> protocols -> \
tls -> ~/.config/wireshark/ssl_keys -> vim add all the keys in below format
"Server IP","PORT","expected protocol (HTTP)","keyfile with full path","<any passwd (empty)>"
reload wireshark, decode application data (tlsv1.2) frame, then http frames will be visible.
